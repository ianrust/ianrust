		This is Ian Rust's personal website. Right now it is currenty primarilty used for email forwarding, but it will eventually contain content of some form.

		There are several Ian Rusts out there on the internet, so I will provide a few key identifiers as to who I am.

		I am the the Ian Rust who:

		<ul>
			<li>...lives in San Francisco</li>
			<li>...builds robots and robot-based systems for fun and profit</li>
			<li>...occasionally paints</li>
			<li>...occasionally brews beer</li>
			<li>...frequently drinks beer</li>
			<li>...hails from the great state of Colorado</li>
			<li>...would gladly take a one-way ticket to Mars</li>
			<li>...loves working on techno-art</li>
		</ul>

		For the time being, these are just claims on my part, but I will continue to flesh out this website and show you.
